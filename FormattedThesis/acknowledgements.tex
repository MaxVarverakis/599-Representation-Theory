I am profoundly grateful to Dr. Sean Gasiorek for his exceptional support in helping me discover and explore a thesis topic that truly resonates with my interests. His willingness to invest time and effort into this endeavor has been invaluable.

I could not have undertaken this journey without the ongoing love and support from my grandparents, Diane and Larry Blau, as well as my parents, Cheryl Blau and Michael Varverakis. Finally, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to my partner, Alexandra Schwartz, for her unwavering support and encouragement throughout my academic pursuits and tribulations.
