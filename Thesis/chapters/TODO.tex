\chapter{To-Do List}\label{ch:todo}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finish/modify irreducible rep. example in \cref{ch:rep_background}.
    \item Lorentz group example?
    \item Probably should redo the \cref{ch:rep_background} with nicer notation and stray away from Tung's notation when possible.

    \item Show $\psi_n(\sigma_i)$ invertible? Yes, eventually
    \item derive $\psi_n^\textbf{r}(\sigma_i)$ matrices or state?
    \item Show $\psi_n^\textbf{r}(\sigma_i)$ invertible? Yes, eventually
    \item \sout{Explicitly show why Burau isn't able to be made unitary?~\cite{Delaney2016}}
    
    \begin{center}\rule{.85\textwidth}{0.65pt}\end{center}
    
    \item Concluding paragraph on first section to lead into the more physics-y stuff.
    \item Show the additional cross terms from $N=2$ to $N=3$ and beyond.
    \item Add paragraph on gauge theory/motivation.
    \item Anyon fusion rules
    \item $\tau$ anyon/Fibonacci anyon example. Relate to singlet/triplet states in spin-1/2 system.
\end{itemize}
