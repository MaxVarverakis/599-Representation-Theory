\chapter{To-Do List}\label{ch:todo}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finish/modify irreducible rep. example in \cref{ch:rep_background}.
    \item Lorentz group example?
    \item Probably should redo the \cref{ch:rep_background} with nicer notation and stray away from Tung's notation when possible.

    \item Show $\psi_n(\sigma_i)$ invertible? Yes, eventually
    \item derive $\psi_n^\textbf{r}(\sigma_i)$ matrices or state?
    \item Show $\psi_n^\textbf{r}(\sigma_i)$ invertible? Yes, eventually
    \item Explicitly show why Burau isn't able to be made unitary?~\cite{Delaney2016}
    \item unitary matrices from $B_n$ acting on $\ket{\Psi}$ (rotation of Hilbert space) example

    \item Go through vector stuff as in paper to connect the cross product stuff to the dot product stuff.
    \item Show the additional cross terms from $N=2$ to $N=3$ and beyond.
    \item Add paragraph on gauge theory/motivation.
    
    \item Anyons: fusion rules
    \item Anyons: $\tau$ anyon/Fibonacci anyon example. Relate to singlet/triplet states in spin-1/2 system.
    \item Anyons: 2 non-interacting anyons example
    \item Anyons: 2 non-interacting anyons in oscillator potential example
    \item Anyons: resolve 2- vs 3-anyon system Hamiltonian (``non-trivial braiding effects!'')
\end{itemize}
