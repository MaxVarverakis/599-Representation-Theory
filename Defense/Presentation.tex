\begin{frame}{Definition of a Representation}

  \vfill

  \begin{definition}
    Let $G$ be a group. A \textit{representation} of $G$ is a homomorphism from $G$ to a group of operators on a linear vector space $V$. The dimension of $V$ is the \textit{dimension} or \textit{degree} of the representation.
  \end{definition}

  \vfill

  \onslide<2->
  If $X$ is a representation of $G$ on a vector space $V$, then $X$ is a map
  \vspace*{-.5em}
  \begin{equation*}
      g\in G\xrightarrow{X} X(g),
  \end{equation*}
  where $X(g)$ is an operator on the $V$.

  \vfill

  \onslide<3->
  \begin{block}{Remark}
    If $V$ is finite-dimensional with basis $\left\{ \e_1,\e_2,\dots,\e_n \right\}$, then $X$ can be realized as an $n\times n$ matrix.
  \end{block}

\begin{frame}{Properties of Representations}

  \setbeamercovered{transparent}

  \begin{block}<2->{Group Multiplication}
    Representations are group morphisms, so they satisfy the group multiplication rule:
    \begin{equation*}
        X(gh) = X(g)X(h), \quad \forall g,h\in G.
    \end{equation*}
  \end{block}

  \vfill

  \begin{block}<3->{Invertibility}
    If $X$ is a representation of $G$, then $X(g)^{-1} = X(g^{-1}),\ \forall g\in G$.
  \end{block}

  \vfill

  \setbeamercovered{invisible}
  \onslide<4->
  \underline{\bfseries Consequences:}
  % \setbeamercovered{transparent}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item<5-> $X(e) = I$, where $e$ is the identity element of the group and $I$ is the identity operator.
    \item<6-> In the matrix presentation of $X$, $X(g)$ is invertible for all $g\in G$.
  \end{enumerate} 

  \vfill

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example: The Trivial Representation}

  \begin{block}<1->{Trivial Representation of a Group}
    For any group $G$, the trivial representation takes $g\mapsto 1$ for all $g\in G$.
  \end{block}

  % \vfill

  \onslide<2->
  \underline{\bfseries Comments:}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> The trivial representation is always one-dimensional.
    \item<3-> For groups with more than one element, the trivial representation is not injective, so we call it a \textcolor{CPgold}{\textit{degenerate representation}}.
    \item<4-> If a representation is injective, then it is a \textcolor{CPgold}{\textit{faithful representation}}.
  \end{itemize}

  \vfill



\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example: A Faithful Representation of $S_n$}

  \vfill

  \begin{block}<1->{Defining representation of $S_n$}
  The defining representation $D$ of $S_n$ encodes the action of the symmetric group on the standard basis of $\R^n$. If a permutation sends $i$ to $j$, then place a 1 the $i$-th column and $j$-th row of the representation matrix.
  \end{block}
  
  \vfill

  \onslide<2->
  E.g., in $S_3$:
  \vspace*{-.75em}
  \setbeamercovered{transparent}
  \begin{align*}
    \onslide<3,5->{D\big((23)\big) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}} \qquad
    \onslide<4->{D\big((123)\big) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}}
  \end{align*}
  
  \vfill

  \setbeamercovered{invisible}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<5-> The defining representation of $S_n$ is $n$-dimensional.
    \item<6-> This representation is faithful.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[t]{Equivalent Representations}
  
  \begin{definition}<1->
    Two representations are \textit{equivalent} if they are related by a similarity transformation.
  \end{definition}
  
  % \vfill

  \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> If two representations are equivalent, then their matrix forms have the same \textcolor{CPgold}{\textit{trace}}.
    \item<3-> Equivalent representations form an equivalence class.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{definition}<4->
    The \textcolor{CPgold}{\textit{character}} of a representation is the trace of the representation matrix.
  \end{definition}
  
  \onslide<5->
  E.g., if $g\in G$ and $X$ is a representation of $G$, then the character of $X(g)$ is $\chi(g) = \tr{X(g)}$.
  
  \vfill
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<6-> If two representations have the same character for all $g\in G$, then they are equivalent.
    \item<7-> We can use characters to classify representations.

\begin{frame}{Decomposing Representations}
  
  \vfill
  
  \begin{definition}<1->
    A representation $X(G)$ on $V$ is \textit{irreducible} if there is no non-trivial invariant subspace\footnote<1->{Invariant subspace $W\subset V$: $X(g)\vec{w}\in W, \, \forall \, \vec{w}\in W$} in $V$ with respect to $X(G)$. Otherwise, $X(G)$ is \textit{reducible}.
  \end{definition}
  
  \vfill

  \onslide<2->
  \underline{\textbf{Comments:}}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<3-> Irreducible representations are the building blocks of all representations.
    \item<4-> A reducible representation can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations.
    \item<5-> The decomposition of a representation into irreducibles is unique up to equivalence.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[t]{Example: Irreducible Representation of 2D Rotations}
  
  % \vfill
  % \onslide<1->
  \textbf{Note:} The subspace spanned by $\e_1$ (or $\e_2$) is \textit{not} invariant under rotations!

  \begin{block}<2->{Invariance of $\e_{\pm}$}
    Let $\e_{\pm} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mp\e_1 + i\e_2\right)$. Then, $X(\phi)\e_{\pm} = e^{\pm i\phi}\e_{\pm}$.
  \end{block}
  
  \vfill

  \onslide<3->
  \begin{block}{Decomposition of $X$}
    The span of each $\e_{\pm}$ is an $X$-invariant subspace of $V_2$. In this basis, we rewrite $X$ as a direct sum of the 1D irreducible representations\footnote<3->{1-dimensional representations are always irreducible!}:
    \begin{equation*}
      X(\phi) = \begin{bmatrix} e^{i\phi} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{-i\phi} \end{bmatrix}.

\begin{frame}{Schur's Lemmas (pt. 1)}

  \begin{lemma}<1->
    Let $X:G\to V$ and $Y:G\to W$ be irreducible representations of a group $G$. If there exists a fixed linear transformation $T:V\to W$ such that $TX(g) = Y(g)T$ for all $g\in G$, then $T$ is either the zero map or invertible.
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{pfsketch}<2->
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item<3-> The kernel of $T$ is invariant under $X(G)$.
      \item<4-> The image of $T$ is invariant under $Y(G)$.
      \item<5-> Since $X$ and $Y$ are irreducible, $\ker(T) = \left\{ \vec{0} \right\}$ and $\text{im}(T) = V$ or $\ker(T) = V$ and $\text{im}(T) = \left\{ 0 \right\}$.
      \item<6-> By the rank-nullity theorem, conclude that $T$ is either the zero map or invertible.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{pfsketch}
  
  \vfill

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Schur's Lemma's (pt. 2)}

  \begin{lemma}
    Let $X$ be an irreducible representation of a group $G$ and $T$ a linear operator that commutes with all $X(g)$ for $g\in G$. Then $T$ is a scalar multiple of the identity operator.
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{pfsketch}<2->
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item<3-> Consider $\lambda$ to be an eigenvalue of $T$.
      \item<4-> Then $T - \lambda I$ is not invertible.
      \item<5-> By assumption, $(T-\lambda I)X(g)=X(g)(T-\lambda I)$ for all $g\in G$.
      \item<6-> By previous lemma, $T-\lambda I = 0 \implies T = \lambda I$.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Consequence of Schur's Lemmas}
  
  \begin{corollary}
    If $G$ is a finite abelian group, then the irreducible representations of $G$ are one-dimensional.
  \end{corollary}

  \begin{pfsketch}<2->
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item<3-> Fix $h\in G$.
      \item<4-> Since $G$ is abelian, $X(h)X(g) = X(g)X(h)$ for all $g\in G$.
      \item<5-> Schur's second lemma implies $X(h)=\lambda_h I$ for some scalar $\lambda_h$.
      \item<6-> The element $h$ was arbitrary, so $X(g) = \lambda_g I$ for all $g\in G$.
      \item<7-> $X(G)$ is equivalent to the representation $g\mapsto \lambda_g$ for all $g\in G$.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> Irreducible representations are the building blocks of all representations.

    \item<3-> Irreducible representations can be combined/modified to create new representations, such as:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item<4-> Direct sums
      \item<5-> Tensor products
      \item<6-> Complex conjugation\footnote<6->{If the representation matrices have entries in $\C$.}
