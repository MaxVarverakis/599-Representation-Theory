\begin{frame}{Definition of a Representation}

\vfill

\begin{definition}
  Let $G$ be a group. A \textit{representation} of $G$ is a homomorphism from $G$ to a group of operators on a linear vector space $V$. The dimension of $V$ is the \textit{dimension} or \textit{degree} of the representation.
\end{definition}

\vfill

\onslide<2->
If $X$ is a representation of $G$ on a vector space $V$, then $X$ is a map
\vspace*{-.5em}
\begin{equation*}
    g\in G\xrightarrow{X} X(g),
\end{equation*}
where $X(g)$ is an operator on the $V$.

\vfill

\onslide<3->
\begin{block}{Remark}
  If $V$ is finite-dimensional with basis $\left\{ \e_1,\e_2,\dots,\e_n \right\}$, then $X$ can be realized as an $n\times n$ matrix.
\end{block}

\begin{frame}{Properties of Representations}

\setbeamercovered{transparent}

\begin{block}<2->{Group Multiplication}
  Representations are group morphisms, so they satisfy the group multiplication rule:
  \begin{equation*}
      X(gh) = X(g)X(h), \quad \forall g,h\in G.
  \end{equation*}
\end{block}

\vfill

\begin{block}<3->{Invertibility}
  If $X$ is a representation of $G$, then $X(g)^{-1} = X(g^{-1}),\ \forall g\in G$.
\end{block}

\vfill

\setbeamercovered{invisible}
\onslide<4->
\underline{\bfseries Consequences:}
% \setbeamercovered{transparent}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item<5-> $X(e) = I$, where $e$ is the identity element of the group and $I$ is the identity operator.
  \item<6-> In the matrix presentation of $X$, $X(g)$ is invertible for all $g\in G$.
\end{enumerate} 

\vfill

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example: The Trivial Representation}

\begin{block}<1->{Trivial Representation of a Group}
  For any group $G$, the trivial representation takes $g\mapsto 1$ for all $g\in G$.
\end{block}

% \vfill

\onslide<2->
\underline{\bfseries Comments:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> The trivial representation is always one-dimensional.
  \item<3-> For groups with more than one element, the trivial representation is not invertible, so we call it a \textcolor{CPgold}{\textit{degenerate representation}}.
  \item<4-> If a representation is an isomorphism, then it is a \textcolor{CPgold}{\textit{faithful representation}}.
\end{itemize}

\vfill



\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example: A Faithful Representation of $S_n$}
\vfill

\begin{block}<1->{Defining representation of $S_n$}
The defining representation $D$ of $S_n$ encodes the action of the symmetric group on the standard basis of $\R^n$. If a permutation sends $i$ to $j$, then place a 1 the $i$-th column and $j$-th row of the representation matrix.
\end{block}
\vfill

\onslide<2->
E.g., in $S_3$:

\setbeamercovered{transparent}
\begin{align*}
  \onslide<3,5->{D\big((23)\big) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}} \qquad
  \onslide<4->{D\big((123)\big) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}}
\end{align*}
\vfill

\setbeamercovered{invisible}
\begin{itemize}
  \item<5-> The defining representation of $S_n$ is $n$-dimensional.
  \item<6-> This representation is faithful.
\end{itemize}

\vfill

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Note that representations work for continuous groups too!
  \item Define rotation group.
  \item Obtain familiar 2D rotation matrix.
  \item Can you think of other ways to represent 2D rotations? What about $e^{i\phi}$ parameterization? How many ways to do this? How many ways are unique? What does it mean to be unique?
\end{enumerate}

\vfill

\begin{block}<2->{Question}
  How do we classify representations of a group?
\end{block}

\vfill

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Basics of characters.
  \item Similar representations have the same character.
  \item Lead into uniqueness of representations.
\end{enumerate}

\vfill

\begin{block}<2->{Question}

  \item Define $\e_{\pm}$.
  \item Show each is invariant.
  \item Decompose previous representation into direct sum of these two.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{A Note About Irreducibility}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Irreducible representations are the building blocks of all representations.
  \item Different ways to construct representations from the irreducibles.
  \item The irreducibles offer insight into the structure of the group.
  \item As for applications in physics, we can use irreps to describe the symmetries of physical systems and understand their consequences.
